Hi there! I am Eric, a Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer from France.

My background is computer science. I hold a MSc in General
Engineering from ECAM Lyon, and a master's degree in Software Engineering
from CentraleSupélec. I graduated in 2016.

After graduating from Centrale, I went working for ManoMano, a french
e-commerce startup specialised in DIY and gardening. I spent 2.5 years there.
I pioneered product recommendations by building a recommender API from scratch,
that increased average basket by 15%. I was in charge of the whole project
and I learned a lot about Data Science, Data Engineering & Devops.
I also worked on product classification, and user tracking.

I eventually left ManoMano to join Doctrine in July 2018.
Doctrine is the fastest growing legal tech startup in Europe, developing a
powerful search engine for lawyers. I joined them as a Senior Data Scientist,
to work on Natural Language Processing, more specifically on a Named Entity
Recognition algorithm used for anonymising legal decisions. I also helped
cleaning the code base and setting best development practices.

In October 2019 I decided to shift my career and start a PhD in Machine
Learning, applied to mededicine, at the Curie Institute of Research in
Paris, France.

Additionnaly to my thesis, I am a Mentor Data Scientist for OpenClassrooms,
the largest e-learning platform in Europe. I help students in Data Science and
Machine Learning.

Besides work, I love music and especially guitar. I have been playing
for 14 years now, recording videos on YouTube. I also love photography
and I upload my pictures on 500px. Sportswise, I have been practicing
karate for 14 years, I am now black belt. I also like working on tech
projects, like a movie recommender system and writing tech articles
on my personal blog.
