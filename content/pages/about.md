I am a Junior Data Scientist from France, currently working for [ManoMano](https://manomano.fr), a fast growing e-commerce startup specialized in DIY and gardening. I graduated from [ECAM Lyon](https://ecam.fr) where I got a Master of Science in General Engineering, and [Ecole Centrale Paris](https://ecp.fr) with a Master of Science in Software Engineering.
I have experience in Software Engineering (mostly Python) and Machine Learning, more specifically within Recommender Systems and Natural Language Processing. I also have some DevOps skills that I gained deploying Cloud Based architectures with Amazon Web Services and Docker.

Besides studies and work, I have been playing guitar since 2004 and I spend some time composing and recording songs or [videos](https://youtube.com/ericmusic13). I am also very keen on [photography](https://500px.com/ericda), karate, golf and biking.
