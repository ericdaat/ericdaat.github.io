Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer with additional Data Engineering and DevOps skills. I am currently working for ManoMano, a fast growing marketplace startup specialized in gardening and DIY that raised 73 million euros in two rounds.

My area of expertise resides within Machine Learning, more specifically Recommender Systems and Natural Language Processing. Since I joined ManoMano, I built their recommendation engines from scratch, implementing state of the art Machine Learning algorithms deployed in an fast and scalable cloud based architecture. I also built their event tracking system, by designing a Lambda Architecture that collects more than 5 million events daily. Finally, I worked on automatic item classification using Deep Learning.

Besides work, I enjoy music, I have been playing guitar for more than 13 years. I have been with several bands, and I am also composing songs and recording videos on YouTube. Still related to art, I am very keen on photography. Sports wise, I love karate, golf and biking. Finally, when I find the time, I write some articles about Software Engineering and Data Science on this personal tech blog.
