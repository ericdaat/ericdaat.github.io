Hi, and welcome to my personal tech blog.

I am Eric, Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer with additional Data Engineering and DevOps skills.  My area of expertise resides within Machine Learning, more specifically Recommender Systems and Natural Language Processing.

I used to be a Data Scientist at [ManoMano](https://manomano.fr), a fast growing marketplace startup specialized in gardening and DIY that raised 73 million euros in two rounds. I built their recommendation engines from scratch, implementing state of the art Machine Learning algorithms deployed in an fast and scalable cloud based architecture. I also built their event tracking system, by designing a Lambda Architecture that collects several million events daily. I also worked on automatic item classification using Natural Language Processing.

I am starting a new job as a Lead Data Scientist at [Doctrine](https://doctrine.fr), a very promising legal tech startup.

Besides work, I enjoy music, I have been playing guitar for more than 13 years. I have been with several bands, and I am also composing songs and recording videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/ericmusic13). Still related to art, I am very keen on [photography](https://500px.com/ericda). Sports wise, I love karate, golf and biking. Finally, when I find the time, I write some articles about Software Engineering and Data Science on this personal tech blog.
