Summary: Lately I spent some time using Deep Learning and configuring Linux servers with GPUs so the models train faster. In this short blog post I am going to list all what you have to follow in order to properly install the nvidia drivers, cuda, and other tools you'll need before running Tensorflow (or Keras) with GPU support.

Lately I spent some time using Deep Learning and configuring Linux servers with GPUs so the models train faster. In this short blog post I am going to list all what you have to follow in order to properly install the nvidia drivers, cuda, and other tools you'll need before running Tensorflow (or Keras) with GPU support. Let's get to it !

# Installing Nvidia Graphic Drivers and Cuda

For this part, I followed instructions from the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers).

``` shell
echo "deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian/ stretch main contrib non-free" > /etc/apt/sources.list
apt update
apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's/[^-]*-[^-]*-//') nvidia-driver
apt install nvidia-xconfig

reboot

apt-get install nvidia-cuda-dev nvidia-cuda-toolkit  nvidia-driver
```

# Installing Cudnn

For this part, you're going to need to register as an Nvidia Developer. Then, download cudnn v6 (Tensorflow needs this version, at least it does while I'm writing these lines) from the [Nvidia Developer Website](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download)

``` shell
cd /home/user
tar xvzf cudnn-8.0-linux-x64-v6.0.tgz
mkdir /usr/local/cuda
mkdir /usr/local/cuda/include
mkdir /usr/local/cuda/lib64
cp -P cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include
cp -P cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64
chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*

echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64"" >> .bashrc
echo "export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda" >> .bashrc

apt-get install libcupti-dev
```

# Installing python, virtualenv and tensforflow-gpu library

This part is the easiest. You can see more details on the [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#InstallingVirtualenv) page.

``` shell
apt-get install python python-pip
virtualenv tensorflow
source tensorflow/bin/activate
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.4 # change to the version you need
```

Et voila ! You should be able to run Tensorflow using GPUs on your Linux server. Just make sure it works by running this simple program:

``` python
import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(hello))
```

# Docker Image
If you are familiar with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), I'd recommend you have a look at the [Tensorflow Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/). It's already configured with the latest drivers and can run on CPU or GPU.

If you're not familiar with Docker, you should definitely learn using it. Here are some links to get you started:
 - [My introduction to Docker blog post](https://ericdaat.github.io/docker-introduction.html)
 - [Docker official website](https://www.docker.com/)
 - [Docker getting started guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

# Install Keras on top of Tensorflow 

This step is not required, and some people probably prefer using Tensorflow directly with no abstraction layer on top of it. I personally started doing Deep Learning with Keras on top of Tensorflow, because it provided a simpler API, and I find it really easy and fast to build models.  
Keras was build by [Fran√ßois Chollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet?lang=en), and since he is now working for Google, Keras is very well integrated with Tensorflow.

Installing keras is as easy as `pip install keras`. It will automatically detect your GPUs if you have `tensorflow-gpu` installed, like we did.

To get started, have a look at the official [Keras website](https://keras.io/) and their [getting started guide](https://keras.io/#getting-started-30-seconds-to-keras). I have also wrote a blog post with some [Keras snippets](https://ericdaat.github.io/keras-snippets.html) that I find useful.

I hope this post was helpful, and have fun with Deep Learning !
