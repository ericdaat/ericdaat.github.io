excerpt:
    I recently read a book about productivity and organization at work.
    More precisely about how to achieve the same amount of work
    in a smaller amount of time. It's french book called "La 25eme heure"
    ("the 25th hour", nothing to do with the movie though) and it made me
    change my habits. I'll sum up the book advices here, and show you what
    works for me.

People who know me will say I am very organized and my room always look very
clean and tidy. Yet, [this book](https://25hbook.com/en/) I read made me
realize I could do better. In this post, I'll briefly sum up the key advices
the author give and show how I have implemented it.

## About the book

The book is written by Guillaume Declair, Bao Dinh and Jerome Dumont. They
are investors and entrepreneurs from France who decided to talk to many
very successful entrepreneurs and gather their productivity and lifestyle
habits. They compiled the advices in this book in a very clear and concise
way. I am going to try to make an even shorter version in this post, but I do
recommend you buy and read their book, there's much more than these few lines.

The book helps you to improve on three levels: organization, focus, and speed.

### Organize

The idea here is to adopt habits to let you spend more time on meaningful
tasks.

1. Learn how to say "no". It's important to ignore all the queries that are
   not related to your goals and priorities. Be clear on what you're trying
   to achieve and kindly explain you're not going to be able to fulfill that
   request.

2. Use todo lists a lot. Write down everything you should to on a todo list
   so you don't need to remember it and you can keep focusing on what you're
   doing without being distracted by this new task you should not forget.
   When you look at your todo list, if there are tasks that will require
   less than two minutes, do it now.

3. Prioritize three tasks per day. Think about what are the three things
   I'd be happy to achieve today, write them down on your today's schedule
   and start working on them. It's important to have them in your calendar
   so that you know you can't plan anything else that would keep you from
   finishing these tasks.

4. Isolate "passive tasks" and start with them. Passive tasks are tasks
   that you won't have to do yourself, but that still require some work from
   your side. For instance if you are to delegate a task, you need to specify
   and explain it to someone. Do these tasks first because meanwhile they're
   handled by that other person, you can work on other things.

5. We often procrastinate when a task seems too complicated or dull. When
   facing such task, it's good to split it in smaller tasks, and get them done
   one at a time. If the task is very boring, set a deadline to force you
   work on it and try to find a way to make it more enjoyable.

### Focus

Now that you're more organized, let's see how to be more focused.

1. Inbox Zero. Archive all your read emails and when they contain something
   you should do or think about, mark that down in your todo-list. It's also
   enough to check your inbox twice or three times a day. Avoid reading your
   mails on the weekend, you deserve a clean break.

2. Setup a morning routine and clean your desk (physical and digital), you
   won't work efficiently if your desk is messy (I know I can't).

3. Asynchronous communication: These are means of communications where you do
   not expect an immediate response, like email or texts. Use them instead of
   phone calls, unless there's an emergency. I have also stopped responding
   to phone calls from people I do not know, unless I'm expecting a call.

4. Notifications: Deactivate most of your phone notifications. Keep only the
   most important ones. I am only keeping texts, phone calls and emails. I also
   block every app on my phone passed 11pm to force me not to use it before
   going to bed.

### Speed

Organization and focus won't be enough to be more productive. Work faster
with the following tips.

1. Proper breaks: It's important to have breaks during the day and don't
   hesitate to have proper lunch breaks. You'd feel more productive and
   creative after a clean lunch break than after a stressful one where you're
   barely eating and working at the same time.

2. Exercise: Sport will keep you healthy and you'd feel more productive
   after it. Also make sure you're eating healthy.

3. Body's clock: If you feel more efficient in the morning, move your meetings
   in the afternoon so you can work faster on meaningful tasks.

4. Automate: If you're doing something more than once, try to automate it.
   Use tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/home) or [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

5. Shortcuts: Use keyboard shortcuts a lot, the less you use your mouse
   the better.

6. The 80-20 rule: Also called the
   [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), this
   rule suggests that 20% of the efforts will achieve 80% of the work. Sometimes
   we can try to overachieve something and lose time on smaller details that
   are not worth it. Keep that in mind.

## Lessons learned

Now that we both know what the book recommends, let me talk about how I
implemented their advices and what works for me.

### Home screens

First, I reorganized my computer and phone screens. I wanted my screens
to look tidy and have only the apps I use the most.

<img src="/assets/img/articles/25th-hour/desktop.jpg" width="90%">

First, here's my computer's desktop screen. As you see it's pretty basic and I
tried to keep only the apps I'm using the most in the dock, that is:

- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/): I always have something playing in the background
- [Spark Email](https://sparkmailapp.com/): We'll get to that later
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): Shocking right?
- [Trello](https://trello.com/): I'm using Trello as a todo-list and I also keep track of what
  I am working on, what's done and what's blocking me for finishing something.
- [iTerm terminal](https://www.iterm2.com/): I'm a computer scientist, I love terminals!
- [Whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com/): While I'm not using it when I'm focusing, the desktop version
  of Whatsapp is so handy, it's much faster to reply.

<img src="/assets/img/articles/25th-hour/phone.jpg" width="40%">

Now here's my phone screen. Again, I'm trying to keep it very simple, elegant
and well organized. Here are the apps I'm using the most:

- Phone, texts, Whatsapp, Messenger, etc ... for talking to friends and family.
- Google Agenda: For my calendar, even though my email app has an integrated
  calendar, I like Google's version. Maybe I'll switch one day who knows.
- [Notion](http://notion.so/): This one I love. Notion combines a lot of tools to make it a very
  handy place to store all your notes, ideas and documents.
- [Habit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habit-daily-tracker/id1445651730): This
  is an app I discovered recently and it helped me a lot. Habit
  is very simple, you write down the habits you wish to do on a regular basis
  and the app reminds you to do them. You can then mark down whether you
  accomplished that habit or not. It's very stupid but it motivates me and I
  have been more serious about my habits since I have this app.
- Notes: Even though I use Notion for keeping notes, I use Notes to quickly
  write down something that I will then develop and move to Notion.
- [Firefox Focus](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus): This
  browser is very handy because it does not track you,
  flushes the history and cookies every time you close a page. You have less
  distraction and more privacy. I like that.
- [Focus To-Do](https://www.focustodo.cn/): is an app based on the Pomodoro
  Technique. We'll also get to that later.

### Emails

For emails, I am using [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/), an email client
available both on mac and iOS. I love the design and features, I have used
Apple default email app for years but I switched for Spark a couple years ago.
My favorite features are the integrated calendar, the ability to schedule
emails, snooze them, make templates, etc ...

<img src="/assets/img/articles/25th-hour/spark.jpg" width="90%">

My emails have always been clean*-ish* and quite organized, but what the book
taught me was to aim for "inbox zero". Before reading the book, I was keeping
all my emails in my inbox, and flag the important ones that I had to remember
about. What I am doing now is archive every email right after I read it. If
the email contains a task I should plan, I am saving that task in my todo list.
I use [Trello](https://trello.com/) as a todo list, and Spark has the ability
to save an email as a Trello card, so it's very convenient to use both.

### Pomodoro technique

The [Pomodoro technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique)
is a very famous method for being more productive at a given task. It's
a time management system that lets you work for 25 minutes straight with no
interruption and deep focus. After these 25 minutes, you're allowed to have a
short break and then back to a 25 minutes session. After 4 sessions, you can
take a longer break, like maybe 20 minutes, before starting the next round.

This really helped me getting more things done, especially things like
programming, reading or writing articles for this blog. I highly recommend it.
You can either use a timer, or your phone timer, or even an app, there are
hundreds of them available. I personally chose
[Focus To-Do](https://www.focustodo.cn/).

## Conclusion

I hope this post was useful to you. I hihgly encourage you to read the
book. Let me know if you have some techniques that work very well for you!
