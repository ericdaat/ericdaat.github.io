excerpt:
  I have been playing guitar since 2004 and I started recording music
  videos on YouTube in 2009. In this post, I am going to explain how I record
  guitar tracks in my home studio. I will detail the gear I am using including
  amp, effects, mics, audio interface and software.

## Basic setup for recording audio

Before I talk about my setup I want to briefly explain the
different tools you need to have a working home studio that will let you
record various instruments:

- **The instrument(s) you want to record**: obviously you must have the
  instruments you want to record with you.
- **A computer**: you will need a computer to record the tracks, mix them and
  export the result as an audio file.
- **An audio interface**: your computer cannot properly record instruments without
  an external audio interface. You will connect your instruments or microphones
  to this interface that will be connected to your computer via USB.
- **A sequencer**: this is a music software that runs on your computer. It will
  recognize your audio interface and let you record the various instruments on
  separate tracks. You can then mix the tracks, apply effects and export the
  final result as an audio file.
- **Headphones or monitoring speakers**: When recording music, you want to have
  proper headphones or speaker to listen what you're recording.`
  More importantly, you want speakers that sound "neutral" and won't color
  the sound. These are called "monitoring" speakers or headphones.
- **Microphones**: If you're recording an instrument that you can't plug
  to your audio interface, you will need to use a microphone. For instance, if
  you're recording drums, you can place various microphones around your kit,
  plug them to your audio interface, and record the different micrphones on
  separate tracks. If you're recording guitar, you can either plug you guitar
  straight into the audio interface and use amps emulation, or place a
  microphone in front of your amp cabinet and record that.
- **MIDI keyboard**: MIDI keyboards are not really capable of producing a sound
  on their own. Instead, they're sending signals and notes to your audio
  interface (or computer directly).
  You can then use audio plugins on your sequencers to emulate
  various instruments, controlled by that keyboard. For instance, you can
  play organ sounds, drumkits, flutes, violins, etc ... all that with the
  keyboard.

## Mix audio and video

Now you know how to record audio tracks. To record good quality music videos,
you will want to record audio and video separately. You will have different
choices:

- Record audio and video at the same time. You will use your phone or a camera
  to record the video, and the previously described setup to record audio.
- Record the audio first, and then film yourself "playing along" the already
  recorded tracks. This is probably what musicians do when they record their
  music videos, they don't record both audio and video at the same time.

Once you're done with audio and video tracks, you will need to use a video
editing software like iMovie, Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere. You will
add your video track, remove its audio track and replace it with the audio
track you recorded on your sequencer. Make sure audio and video are in sync
so it doesn't look like you faked your video, and you're done.

## My setup

Now that we covered the basic, let me show how I am recording my videos and
what gear I am using.

### Recording gear overview

Here's a non exhaustive list of the gear I am using in my home studio:

#### Studio gear

My studio gear is fairly simple, here is what I am using:

- **Audio Interface**: [MOTU 828 mkIII](https://motu.com/products/motuaudio/828x)
- **Speakers**: [Yamaha HS Speakers](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/proaudio/speakers/hs_series/index.html)
- **MIDI Keyboard**: [M-Audio Axiom](https://www.m-audio.com/products/view/axiom-49)
- **Sequencer**: [Apple Logic Pro X](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/)
- **Microphones**:
  - [Shure SM57](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm57)
  - [Rode NT-1](http://www.rode.com/microphones/nt1)

#### Guitar gear

This part gets a bit more complicated, here's the list of what I'm using and
I'll explain how they are setup and why:

- **Guitars**: I have a lot, I'll probably write a dedicated post about my guitars.
- **Amplifier**: Elmwood Modena M60
- **Mic & Cabinet simulation**: [Two Notes Torpedo Live](https://www.two-notes.com/torpedo-live)
- **Effects**:
  - [TC Electronic G System](https://www.tcelectronic.com/Categories/Tcelectronic/Guitar/Effects-Processors/G-SYSTEM/p/P0CKX)
  - Various distortion and overdrive pedals

First, I plug my guitar into my TC Electronic G System multi effect unit. This
unit is no longer manufactured but it sounds great, very versatile and handy.
The unit has almost every effect built in, like reverbs, delays, modulations,
uni-vibe, wah-wah, whammy, etc ... It does not provide overdrives though, but
you can plug up to 4 external overdrive pedals in the system and control them
via the dedicated switches. The unit can also control your amplifier channels
and midi devices. In the end, you can create different presets by choosing
among the various effects, overdrives and amp settings.

I am using an Elmwood Modena M60 amplifier. Unfortunately this brand no longer
exists but they were making awesome amps, hand built in Sweden. It's 60 watts
tube amplifier, with 2 channels (but each channel has a boost so it's almost
a 4 channel amp). I'm controlling the amp channels with the G System.

Then, my amplifier goes into a Two Notes Torpedo Live. This unit is a load box
and a speaker plus microphone simulation device. This means that I do not need
to have a speaker connected to amplifier, the unit has various cabinets
simulation built in, they're all very high quality and sound great. Since I
do not have a cabinet, I can crank my amplifier and let the tube screams,
it sounds much better this way. I can listen to the recorded sound via
headphones or speakers and adjust the volume so that I don't annoy the
neighbors. It's possible to setup different presets on the Torpedo Live,
by using different cabinets and microphones combinations and settings. I am
controlling the presets with my G System once again. This means that when I
create G System presets, I can chose a combination of:

- Guitar effects
- Amp channels
- Speaker simulation
- Microphone

Finally, my Torpedo Live is plugged into my MOTU audio interface, connected
to my Mac Book Pro which runs Logic Pro X.

## Conclusion

I am a guitar nerd. I love learning about new gear that's coming out and
spending some time tweaking my settings and trying new sounds. I hope that
post helped you in some way. Don't hesitate to let me know in the comments,
and please check out my music videos on my
