# About

<font-awesome-icon icon="coffee"></font-awesome-icon>

Hi there! I am Eric, a Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer from France.

My background is computer science. I hold a master’s degree in General Engineering from ECAM Lyon, and an advanced master in Software Engineering from Centrale Paris.
After graduating from Centrale, I went working for ManoMano, a french e-commerce startup specialised in DIY and gardening. I spent 2.5 years there. I pioneered product recommendations by building a recommender API from scratch, that increased average basket by 15%. I was in charge of the whole project and I learned a lot about Data Science, Data Engineering & Devops. I also worked on product classification, and user tracking.
I eventually left ManoMano to join Doctrine, a french legal tech startup, to work on Natural Language Processing. I worked on a Named Entity Recognition algorithm used for anonymising legal decisions. I also helped cleaning the code base and setting best development practices.

Besides work, I love music and especially guitar. I have been playing for 14 years now, recording videos on YouTube. I also love photography and I upload my pictures on 500px. Sportswise, I have been practicing karate for 14 years, I am now black belt. I also like working on tech projects, like a movie recommender system and writing tech articles on my personal blog.

# Projects

## [Sentiment Classifier API](https://github.com/ericdaat/sentiment-classifier)
The goal of this project is to create a sentiment classifier API that could use various models and datasets. It is written in Python and uses Flask for the API and tensorflow/keras for Machine Learning.


## [Notflix](https://github.com/ericdaat/notflix)
Notflix is an open source movie recommender system, inspired by a famous movie company. I am using the data from Movielens to build recommendation algorithms and expose them to users via a web application. It is a side project I started working on for fun and it is not yet fully completed. Feel free to ask for contribution on my Github.


## [Webradio to Spotify](https://github.com/ericdaat/webradio-to-spotify)
As a big fan of Classic Rock living in France, I am very frustrated by the lack of good classic rock radio we have. I spent four months in St Louis, MO, and I had the chance to listen to KSHE 95 every day, playing some of my favorite classic rock tunes. I decided to make myself an empty Spotify playlist, and automatically add in the KSHE tracks. I also wanted to be able to add songs from other similar Classic Rock radio. So I built a reusable architecture that enables to register different web scrapers to get the radio playing history and add that into my playlist.


## [Personal Blog](/blog)
I started a personal blog about Software Engineering. You'll find some tutorials and various programming tricks I learned through my work experience. I am using Python's Pelican and Github Pages to publish it.


## [YouTube Music Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVuDs3gy11RXRd5m-TSRAyQ)
I am a huge music fan and I have been playing guitar since 2004. In 2009, I started recording videos on YouTube, covering famous songs and guitar solos and also composing some of my own tunes.


## [500px Photography Gallery](https://500px.com/ericda)
I love photography and I publish some of my pictures on a 500px gallery. I mostly enjoy landscape and architecture photos. I recently tried Street Photography and I planned on diving a little more into it later.
