I've been playing the guitar since 2004. I used to have a band but now
I'm mostly playing on my own, recording music videos to put on my
YouTube channel. I like different genres, from Classic Rock
to Blues and more recently Jazz.

On this channel you will find guitar videos, mainly covers but also some
jams, random improvisations and gear test. Feel free to
like and subscribe if you like my work.
