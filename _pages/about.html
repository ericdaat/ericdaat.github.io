    My background is computer science. I hold a MSc in General
    Engineering from ECAM Lyon, and a master's degree in Software Engineering
    from CentraleSup√©lec. I graduated in 2016.
</p>

<p>
    After graduating from Centrale, I went working for ManoMano, a french
    e-commerce startup specialised in DIY and gardening. I spent 2.5 years there.
    I pioneered product recommendations by building a recommender API from scratch,
    that increased average basket by 15%. I was in charge of the whole project
    and I learned a lot about Data Science, Data Engineering & Devops.
    I also worked on product classification, and user tracking.
</p>

<p>
    I eventually left ManoMano to join Doctrine in July 2018.
    Doctrine is the fastest growing legal tech startup in Europe, developing a
    powerful search engine for lawyers. I joined them as a Senior Data Scientist,
    to work on Natural Language Processing, more specifically on a Named Entity
    Recognition algorithm used for anonymising legal decisions. I also helped
    cleaning the code base and setting best development practices.

    In October 2019 I decided to shift my career and start a PhD in Machine
    Learning, applied to oncology, at the Curie Institute of Research in
    Paris, France.

<p>
    Additionnaly to my thesis, I am a Mentor Data Scientist for OpenClassrooms,
    the largest e-learning platform in Europe. I help students in Data Science and
    Machine Learning.

    Besides work, I love music and especially guitar. I have been playing
    for 14 years now, recording videos on YouTube. I also love photography
    and I upload my pictures on 500px. Sportswise, I have been practicing
    karate for 14 years, I am now black belt. I also like working on tech
    projects, like a movie recommender system and writing tech articles
    on my personal blog.
