    I am currently a PhD Student in Machine Learning applied to oncology,
    at <a href="https://institut-curie.org/">Institut Curie</a>
    and <a href="https://www.inria.fr/">INRIA</a>,
    in Paris. I am supervised by Professor
    <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=VRZhLFsAAAAJ&hl=fr">Fabien Reyal</a> (Institut Curie)
    and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cLGOIdMAAAAJ&hl=en">Marc Lelarge</a> (INRIA).
    Here is a brief description of my PhD subject.

<p class="text-center font-weight-bold">Geographic and socio-demographic disparities in oncology care pathways.</p>

<p>
    In France, during year 2018, there was 382,000 new cancer cases and 157,400 deaths. The 2014-2019 Cancer Plan sets
    new objectives for cancer care in France. In particular, objectives 2 and 7 emphasize the quality of the care
    pathways: they aim respectively to guarantee the quality and safety of care and ensure comprehensive and
    personalized care. In order to standardize the care pathways while personalizing care, care trajectories have been
    introduced. The definition of these optimal care trajectories is based on national and international good practice
    recommendations. We propose to study in detail the geographical and socio-demographic disparities in the care
    pathways of cancer patients in France. First, we will try to characterize the health care institutions in France
    based on their oncology activity. Then, we will study the distribution of these centers on the territory, in order
    to highlight possible disparities in access to them. Finally, we will try to propose a care center recommendation
    algorithm, using the French social security database (SNDS). This algorithm will aim at guiding patients towards the
    optimal center, in order to maximize the quality of the care pathways.
