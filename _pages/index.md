Hi, I'm Eric, a Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer with additional
Data Engineering and DevOps skills.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning
applied to cancerology at the Curie Institute of Research in Paris, France.
Besides work, I am really keen on music, photography, karate and golf.

In this website, you will find some more details about who I am and what I am
working on as PhD Student. I also work on various open source projects that
are listed on the [open source](open-source) page. When I find the time, I like
to write short tech related articles on my [blog page](blog), feel free to
check it out! I also added two sections not related to code:
[photography](photography) and [music](music).
