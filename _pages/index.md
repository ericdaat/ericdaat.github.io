Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer. Currently founder in residence at Entrepreneur First, 
I'm looking at ways to build a SaaS company with a positive impact on the environment. 
Prior to this, I was a PhD Student at Institut Curie and INRIA, working on Machine Learning 
techniques to reduce geographic disparities in oncology care pathways.

In this website, you will find some more details about [who I am](about) and what I am
[working on as PhD Student](research). I also work on various open source projects that
are listed on the [open source](open-source) page. When I find the time, I like
to write short tech related articles on my [blog page](blog), feel free to
check it out! I also added two sections not related to code:
[photography](photography) and [music](music).
