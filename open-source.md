## Projects

Here are some open source projects I am working on.

### [Sentiment Classifier API](https://github.com/ericdaat/sentiment-classifier)

The goal of this project is to create a sentiment classifier API that could use various models and datasets. It is written in Python and uses Flask for the API and tensorflow/keras for Machine Learning.

### [Notflix](https://github.com/ericdaat/notflix)

Notflix is an open source movie recommender system, inspired by a famous movie company. I am using the data from Movielens to build recommendation algorithms and expose them to users via a web application. It is a side project I started working on for fun and it is not yet fully completed. Feel free to ask for contribution on my Github.

### [Webradio to Spotify](https://github.com/ericdaat/webradio-to-spotify)

As a big fan of Classic Rock living in France, I am very frustrated by the lack of good classic rock radio we have. I spent four months in St Louis, MO, and I had the chance to listen to KSHE 95 every day, playing some of my favorite classic rock tunes. I decided to make myself an empty Spotify playlist, and automatically add in the KSHE tracks. I also wanted to be able to add songs from other similar Classic Rock radio. So I built a reusable architecture that enables to register different web scrapers to get the radio playing history and add that into my playlist.

## Code templates

I love creating templates to re-use in various projects. Here is a list of all
the templates I made so far.

### [Data Stack](https://github.com/ericdaat/data-stack)

A sample data stack running on Docker, that contains some standard services
like Metabase, Airflow, a Python package with Sphinx docs, pytest, etc.

### [Python Flask app](https://github.com/ericdaat/flask-template)

Template for a Python Flask web application along with sqlalchemy,
docker, circle-ci and sphinx.

### [Python project](https://github.com/ericdaat/template-python)

A template repository for a python package. Pre configured sphinx and pytest.

### [Research Lab static website](https://github.com/ericdaat/research-lab-website)

A template for a Research Lab website, built with Jekyll.
It is derived from the great template provided by the Allan Lab,
at Leiden University.
